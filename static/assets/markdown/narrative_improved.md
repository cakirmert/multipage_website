# Carbonate System modelling

_Lukas Rieder_

Here will be my explanaition of the  equations and assumptions from the Book (Steven Emerson , John Hedges). The squared brackets imply the concentration is meant:

$$ 
c( CO_3^{2-} ) = [ CO_3^{2-} ]. 
$$

Also because carbonic acid $H_2 CO_3$ is very unstable and it is difficult to distinguish it from  $[CO_{2}(aq)]$  both compounds are combined to:

$$ 
[CO_2 ] = [CO_2(aq) ]+ [H_2 CO_3 ].
$$

Thus the first dissociation constant is actually a combined one of two reactions ( $CO_2(aq) + H_2 O ->  H_2 CO_3 -> HCO_3^{-} + H^{+}$ ).

The dissociation constansts $K_1^{'}$ $K_{2}^{'}$ as well as the Henrys law constant $K_H$  are Temperature dependent. This dependece is rather complex to describe so I wont show the equations for the temperature dependence here.

All equations neccessary to describe/solve the full carbonate system are listed below:

1. total dissolved inorganic carbon: 
$$ 
DIC = [ CO_2 ] + [ HCO_3^- ] + [ CO_3^{2-} ] 
$$

2. alkalinity **extremely** simplified (carbonate alkalinity):  
$$ 
A_C=[ HCO_3^{-} ]  +2 \cdot [ CO_3^{2-} ] + [ OH^{-} ] - [ H^{+} ] 
$$

3. First Dissociation Constant of carbonic acid: 
$$ 
K_1^{'} = \frac{ [HCO_3^{-}] \cdot [H^{+}] }{ [CO_2 ] } 
$$

4. Second Dissociation Constant of carbonic acid: 
$$ 
K_2^{'}=\frac{ [CO_3^{2-}] \cdot [H^{+} ] }{ [ HCO_3^{-} ] } 
$$

5. Solubility of Gas (Henry's law constant $H$ \[L atm / mol \] ): 
$$ 
K_H=\frac{ [CO_2 ]  }{ H } 
$$

6. Temperature dependence of Henry's law constant $H(T)$,  $H_{ref}$ is the Henry's law constant of CO2 at the reference temperature $T_{ref}=298.15K$ and the Temperature $T$ must be used in Kelvin:  
$$ 
H(T) = H\_{ref} \cdot exp(2400 \cdot (\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T\_{ref}})) 
$$

7. Dissociation Constant of water:  
$$ 
K_w = [H^{+} ] [OH^{-} ]  
$$

8. When other weak acids (HB) are involved:  
$$ 
K_{HB} = \frac{ [ H^{+} ] [ B^{-} ]}{ [HB ]} 
$$




However the model you find here is not calculated with the simplification of alkalinity. Everything is calculated with [phreeqpython](https://github.com/Vitens/phreeqpython) a python toolbox designed for solving environmental chemistry problems.

The current global mean level of atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 gas you can get from [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/global.html).


# Ion Activity Product (IAP) and Saturation Index (SI)

[//]: # (when using curly braces the underscores also need to be escaped with curly brackets need to be escaped to show \{ )

The law of mass action in (1) determines the activities at the state of equilibrium, $\{A\}_{eq}$ and $\{B\}_{eq}$:

(1) 
$$ 
K_{sp} = \dfrac{ \{A\}^{a}\{B\}^{b}}{\{A_{a}B_{b}\}} = \{A\}^{a}\{B\}^{b} 
$$


(2) 	chem equilibrium: 	
$$ 
K_{sp} = \{A\}_{eq}^{a} \{B\}_{eq}^{b} 
$$

However, a real solution may not be in the state of equilibrium. The non-equilibrium state is 
described by the ion activity product (IAP). It has the same math form as the equilibrium constant $K_{sp}$,
but involves the actual activities, $\{A\}_{actual}$ and $\{B\}_{actual}$:

(3) 	non-equilibrium:  
$$ 
IAP = \{A\}_{actual}^{a} \{B\}_{actual}^{b} 
$$

The decadic logarithm of the ratio of $IAP$ to Ksp defines of the saturation index:

(4) saturation index: 	
$$
SI = \lg \left( \dfrac{\textrm{IAP}}{K_{sp}} \right)
$$

The saturation index is a useful quantity to determine whether the water is saturated,
undersaturated, or supersaturated with respect to the given mineral:

- SI = 0 	$IAP$ = $K_{sp}$ saturated  (in chem equilibrium)
- SI < 0 	$IAP$ < $K_{sp}$ undersaturated
- SI > 0 	$IAP$ > $K_{sp}$ supersaturated
